ONE_TACTICAL_ACTION
ONE_ROUND
ONE_COMBAT

so we exahust or play a card to use one of these 

then later we press combat_roll 

the one_round ones are fine, cause you add them to a list, then end of the rolls code you remove them from the list

one_combat ones need to know if the unit holder or active turn is different from when they were played 

one_tactical_action needs to know the system that was activated, and the active player 


You dont have a huge striaght line, they might just call the command, or call system_info and press the button in a non-fighting channel

player.unusedCombatModifiers.add(any, player.numTurns)

/combat_roll (000 space)
    - if unsused - use (unless its a different turn, then empty it)
        - if one_round - use - dont add to recoop
        - if one_combat - reuse in this combat (000 space) (add to recoop with combat details)
        - if one tactical action - reuse in this system & turn (000, player.num_turns) (add to recoop with system details)

    - if recooped 
        - check against conditions - then use 
        - otherwise remove from recoop (for one_combat, this changes as soon as unit_holder changes, for one_tactical_action this changes when system is different)
