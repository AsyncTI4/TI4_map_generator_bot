Commands:
First you need to create game and set active game you modifying.
To create game use:
/create_game gameName vpCount(optional) <- creates game and can set VP count of game, optional
To set active game use:
/set_game gameName <- Map name can only contain a-z A-Z 0-9 symbols
Now automatically sets active map in channels that go: gameName-map-updates
so in any channel that is named like this, you don't need to set active map, it automatically sets for you
so switching between games is much easier.

/game set_game_status status gameName(Optional)
status: open or locked
Status open, means anyone can edit map, can join map as player;
Status locked means, only joined players and map creator can edit map. No more players can join
Game auto locks open map if it's does not have community mode, when any SC card is picked if was open, will get locked.
/game join gameName <- join an open map to be able to edit even if map is locked
/game leave gameName <- leave an open map
/game info gameName <- information of map, status if open/locked and player list
/game add @playerName... gameName <- add single or multiple players to game, gameName is optional and can bet set if no activeMap present
/game remove  @playerName... gameName <- remove single or multiple players to game, gameName is optional and can bet set if no activeMap present
/game set_order @playerName1 @playerName2 .....gameName
Add all players in order for game
/game sc_count <- sets game SC count, used if game requires more than 8 Strategy cards, default is 8
/game setup display_type(optional) vpCount(optional) player_count_for_map(optional) community_mode(optional) alliance_mode(optional) <- sets default display type for game. All (map + player stats), map or player stats, Sets Game VP count (10 default), alliance mode turns off auto planet add to player area when last unit is left on planet
player_count_for_map set player map count 6 (default) or 8 for bigger map
community_mode is for games were multiple players handle single faction
/game setup community_mode:YES
then
/game community_setup player1 role1 channel1
player1 is dummy player in map or real, role1 is the team role and channel1 is team channel
can setup up to 8 at once

/game replace FACTION_COLOR @replacementPlayer <- can replace a player in game (faction/color), only game players can do command
/game setup game_custom_name @custom text <- can add custom text to game

For easy of setup suggest first command after map creation use
/map add_tile setup 0
This adds a template with positions

Now additional commands:
/map add_tile tileName positionOnMap
(We using somno template positions on map. from setup template and you see positions.
Also we support TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft and BottomRight positions corresponding to TL, TR, BL, BR
Mecatol position is MR)
/map add_tile_list tileList <- tile list is code from map Generators like TTS uses, example: https://ti4-map-generator.derekpeterson.ca/
You can use also tileID, so liek TI4 marks tiles 01 is Jord for example
/remove_tile tileName or position
/delete_game <-deletes your game, only can delete the map you created
/show_game gameName(optional) display_type(optional) <- displays the game map, display_type can be set to all, map, stats. Displays map + player stats, just map or just player stats
If you have active game set, it shows your active game if no game name is defines
/add_cc colorList(factionList) tile or position <- adds CC to system: colorList can be pink,red,black as example/
/remove_cc colorList(FactionList) tile or position <- removes CC from system: colorList can be pink,red,black as example/
/remove_all_cc confirmation(YES) <- need to type in YES, will remove all CCs from active game
/add_control faction_or_color tile planetList <- need to specify tile and planetList, example /add_control pink 3a arnor,lor
/remove_control faction_or_color tile planet
and most interesting is
/add_units tile unitList faction_or_color add_cc_from_tactics(optional) <- add_cc_from_tactics if types yes or y, will remove CC from tactics and add to tile
/remove_units tile unitList faction_or_color
/remove_all_units tile faction_or_color
/add_damage_unit tile unitList faction_or_color
/remove_damage_unit tile unitList faction_or_color
/remove_damage_all_unit tile faction_or_color
/add_frontier_tokens CONFIRM(YES) <- adds frontier tokens to all tiles that can have one

EXAMPLE
/add_units faction_or_color tile unitList
examples
tile can be tile name or the number of location at bottom right
like 1a, 2b, 3c etc
for units
can do
carrier, dread, fighter, infantry, inf all go in space by default
if you want to place to planet need to do
inf lodor, sd lodor
or any char combination like
lodor, lodo, lod, lo, l
all work to place unit on planet
example
/add_units blue 1c carrier, ff, 2 inf l, sd l, 3 inf
this command would place blue units in tile 1c
carrier, fighter, 3 infantry in space
2 infantry and space dock on lodor planet (or any planet beginning with letter L in that tile)

commands improvements:
/remove_units and /move_units
priority is move/remove damaged units. If we select priority_no_damage (and type in yes or y)
units without damage will be removed/moved to other system
also moves damage to new system by default if option  is not specified

unitList examples and explanation. If don't specify planet, all units go into space
Listing only unit list, so add into command that you want
dn <- single dread into space
dread <- same single dread into space
3 dn <- 3 dreads added into space
3 dn, 2 destroyers <- 3dread and 2 dd added into space
3 dn, 2 dd, gf quann <- 3 dread and 2dd added into space, 1 gf added onto planet quann
ws, 6 ff, sd quann, 3 inf quann, mech quann <- warsun and 6 fighters added into space, spacedock, 3 infantry and mech added into quann

/move_units systemFrom unitList systemTo unitListTo faction_or_color cc (optional can be no or retreat)
Standard fields to add tile/system, unit list same as add, remove, and we have optional field addCC, type anything in to not add CC into moved system
unitListTo <- if you enter 0 or none into as a unit, no unit will spawn in target system :)
Example:
/move_units pink quann 2 dn, dd, gf, gf quann wellon 2 dn, dd, 2 gf wellon

now: add_units, remove_units, move_units command, for planet name, you can use short of existing planet
example
Arnor/Lor, can use a and l, or ar or arno, or lo
Sakulag/Lazar example: s and l, or sa and la
Abyz/Fria like a and f etc
so you don't need full name, can use first letter or few first letters, if system with same starting letter like
Tequran/Torkan, can use te and to ðŸ™‚
hope helps speed things up
