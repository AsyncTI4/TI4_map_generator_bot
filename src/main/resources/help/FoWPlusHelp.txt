## FoW+ — "To make fog even foggier"

A special Fog of War variant by Solax for those who think the unknown isn’t unknown enough.

__**Major changes:**__
> Only tiles next to your own are visible — unexplored (0b) tiles vanish completely, obscuring even the map’s shape.
> Player stats visible only when adjacent to their Home System.
> Total votes and voting order are hidden.
> Explore and Relic decks cannot be viewed.
> No communication during the Agenda Phase.
> Anchored player info areas are hidden.

__**Other effects:**__
> You can only activate tiles you can see — or use the Blind Tile button to venture into the unknown.
> Activating a position without a tile sends your ships into The Void.
> You cannot remove tokens from tiles you cannot see.
> Includes a custom explore deck with new FoW+-exclusive cards.

Many of these FoW+ features can also be toggled individually in standard Fog of War games.
