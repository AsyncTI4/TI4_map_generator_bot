This channel is for you to take actions in the game.

__**General Tips:**__
> Ping your GM here for any questions.
> Run all commands here, never in the main channel.
> After your faction is set up, use `/show_game` to view the map.

__**Communication Tips:**__
> In FoW, you may only talk to neighbors—ask your GM if this includes the Agenda phase.
> Use `tored Hello neighbor!` to anonymously message red.
> Use Open Comms button located with Start/End Turn buttons to suggest private communications to neighbors, or
> `/fow check_private_communications`to show the button.

__**Action Card Tips:**__
> `/fow whisper anon:y` – Anonymously notify a player they are the target.
> `/fow ping_system` – Announce a system/planet target to players who can see that system.
> `/fow announce anon:y` – Make a public announcement to the main channel.

__**Combat tips:**__
> Each participant gets their own combat thread; spectators get a thread to spectate the interraction.
> Messages in the combat thread relay between threads, so you can talk normally; no need to whisper.
> PDS2 isn't implemented; please handle it manually when prompted.
> Use `/combat combat_roll tile_name:{target_system} rolltype:spacecannonoffence` for PDS2 rolls.
