TIGL is a competitive league of TI4 players run in quarterly seasons. Please see the link below for the Code of Conduct, how to start a game, check your stats, gain ranks, and everything else!

## TIGL Ranks Primer
Everyone starts with no rank, and then as they win TIGL games, can gain ranks (see link below). To gain a new rank, you generally must win a TIGL game against people who all have at least that rank at the start.
