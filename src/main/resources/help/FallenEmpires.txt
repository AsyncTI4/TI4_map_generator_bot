# Fallen Empires

## __**Information**__
The Fallen Empires Expansion is a stand-alone mini-expansion of cards that aims to encourage a continuation of ‘presence’ in the galactic slice of a player who has to leave the game early. It avoids the sudden power void of a player leaving the game by providing a narrative and rules for NPC unit combat and a cost for taking the suddenly abandoned systems.
