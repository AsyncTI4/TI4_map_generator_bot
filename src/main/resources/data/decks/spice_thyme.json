        "description": "A curated and semi-randomly standardized set chosen from the base game and officially expanded by POK, the codices, and enhanced with homebrew from Action Card Deck 2, Uncharted Space, Milty Mod, Voice of the Council, and Sigma for Spicy Mode [with some Thyme thrown in for good measure]. [Link to Sample Distributions, Chances, and Sources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mft8R0FlyHdf8dxef5W2VKAyPjOTNKMMxhS2GGxRtmY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n-# Amongst this approximately 100 action card deck there are a minimum 2 each of the Classified Weapons, Defense Installations, Diplomatic Pressure, Direct Hit, Diversion, Flank Speed, Manuevering Jets, Morale Boost, Outgun, Outmaneuver, Overthrow, Pirate Contract, Professional Archaeologists, Relay Assembly, Sabotage, Sacrifice, Shields Holding, Side Project, Skilled Retreat, Strategize, War Machine, and Weirdway cards. There is an expectation of 4 each of the Direct Hit and Sabotage cards. Additionally, there is a guarantee of at least 1 each Archaeological Expedition, Assasinate Representative, Counterstroke, Decoy, Disable, Distinguished Councilor, Divert Funding, Exploration Probe, Focused Research, Frontline Deployment, Ghost Ship, In the Silence of Space, Infiltrate, Insider Information, Lost Star Chart, Master Plan, Nav Suite, Plagiarize, Planetary Rigs, Public Disgrace, Reveal Prototype, Rout, Secured Trove, Unexpected Action, and Veto cards. The remaining 25% of cards are randomly selected from a curated list to provide an unexpected yet balanced and fun gameplay experience and will occasionally be re-seeded to maintain unpredictability.\n\n**This distribution creates an expectation of roughly 25% chance of an opponent holding 7 action cards to have a direct hit.**",
